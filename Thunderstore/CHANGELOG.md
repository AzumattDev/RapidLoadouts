|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.0.9     | - Fix problems in the readme<br/> - Change the configurations to not say ItemSet and now say Loadout. You will need to delete and regenerate your configuration file. The code now looks for a yaml with the name `Azumatt.RapidLoadouts_Loadouts.yml` and not `Azumatt.RapidLoadouts_ItemSets.yml` a simple rename of the file will fix the loading of them. |
| 1.0.8     | - Add the ability to store personal loadouts. The loadouts save to the player and only store/load equipped items.  <br/>- Expand the example file <br/> - Add new image                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1.0.7     | - Add the ability to block loadouts behind global keys. Some of the examples were updated to show this, just use `requiredGlobalKey` and set up the key. Example `requiredGlobalKey: "defeated_bonemass"`                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1.0.6     | - Forgot about some code that was in there. Used the code to pre-generate the file so now all vanilla loadouts are in the file and configurable.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.0.5     | - Recompile for Ashlands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1.0.4     | - No one said it was broken, but it's fixed now. Figured it out in my own testing :D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
