|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.0.7     | - Add the ability to block itemsets behind global keys. Some of the examples were updated to show this, just use `requiredGlobalKey` and set up the key. Example `requiredGlobalKey: "defeated_bonemass"` |
| 1.0.6     | - Forgot about some code that was in there. Used the code to pre-generate the file so now all vanilla itemsets are in the file and configurable.                                                          |
| 1.0.5     | - Recompile for Ashlands.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1.0.4     | - No one said it was broken, but it's fixed now. Figured it out in my own testing :D                                                                                                                      |
